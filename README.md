## A Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) Game Library

Welcome to the <i>Deep Reinforcement Learning Game Library</i>! 

This is a collection of games and playful simulations designed with two goals in mind:
 - To pit users against custom-trained deep learning bots.
 - To introduce fellow gamers and developers to a profound application of programming in game development!

## Description

**Deep Reinforcement Learning** is a powerful tool both blessed and cursed by its complexity and creative uses. 

With these projects, I aim to learn more and dig deeper into the mathematical and algorithmic mechanics behind deep learning and data science, so to better understand its usefulness in today's world.

Please *star* this repo and *follow* my progress into the world of deep learning! 

:-)

## Progression

### CURRENT GAMES:
- Tic Tac Toe (_In Progress._)
- Snake (_v0 Complete!_)

### FUTURE GAMES:
- Super Mario Brothers
- The Binding of Isaac
- Grand Theft Auto 5

#### Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
    - PyGame
    - Keras (TensorFlow)
    - NumPy, Pandas
